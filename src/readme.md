/network

Folder containing source code that uses spectral clustering 
to find clusters of proteins and corresponding genes based on the protein interaction $
network.
The file 'protein_genes_index.csv' contains a list of all proteins and their coding genes
from the protein interaction network, along with their node ID in the network.
The file 'protein_gene_cluster_assign.csv' is similar to the previous file, except that 
there is an additional column specifying the cluster the gene is assigned to.
